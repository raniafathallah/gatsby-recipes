They’re incredibly soft and feathery, the perfect balance of sweet and salty, and beat all Parker House rolls I’ve had at past holiday dinners. However, there are a few things to keep in mind in order to achieve the perfect texture, so I highly recommend reading the tips and tricks section below as well as fully reading each recipe step before starting:\r\n\r\nTips & Tricks:\r\n• This recipe is made with tangzhong, which is a popular Asian baking technique that involves pre-cooking the flour and liquid (in this case milk) until it reaches at least 150ºF/65ºC and resembles a paste. The cooking process gelatinizes the starches in the flour, which helps the dough to absorb more liquid later on. Adding tangzhong to a dough helps to create a much fluffier, softer and tender texture.\r\n• Kneading is one of the most important parts of making milk buns when looking to get that pillowy-soft and feathery texture. The longer you knead, the more you develop the gluten, and the more feathery strands the buns will have. I write more about how to know if you’ve kneaded enough in Step 3. If you don’t knead long enough, the buns will be more bready and almost crumbly.\r\n• Make sure you let the dough proof long enough both in the first and second round. If you don’t, the buns might crack on the top and around the sides while baking. To test, gently poke your finger into the dough. If it barely dents and springs back completely, it needs to rest longer. If it dents and springs back halfway, it’s ready. (PLEASE NOTE: You also don’t want to overproof them. If the dent doesn’t spring back at all, they have overproofed.)\r\n• If you want to speed up the proofing process, cover the bowl with plastic wrap, turn the light on in your oven, and proof the dough in the oven until doubled in size. You can do the same thing with the second proof too.\r\n• You can use active dry yeast instead of instant, just make sure you activate the yeast. After adding the tangzhong to the bowl of the mixer, heat the remaining milk to 98ºF (no hotter as this can kill the yeast). Pour in the milk, then sprinkle in the yeast. Let the yeast activate for about 5 minutes.\r\n• If doubling the recipe, follow instructions as written, but either bake in a 9x13-inch baking dish or bake in two separate skillets.\r\n• To make ahead, prepare the recipe the evening before through step 5. Wrap in plastic wrap and let the buns slowly proof in the refrigerator overnight. Remove them from the fridge to come to room temperature about 30 minutes before baking, while the oven preheats.\r\n—Nea Arentzen","ingredients":["TANGZHONG:","3 tablespoons (22 grams) bread flour (all-purpose is fine too)","1/2 cup (113 grams) whole milk","DOUGH:","2 1/4 teaspoons (7 grams) instant dry yeast (see tip)","1/2 cup (113 grams) whole milk","4 tablespoons (57 grams) unsalted butter, softened","1/4 cup (49 grams) granulated sugar","1 large egg","1 1/2 teaspoons Diamond crystal kosher salt","2 3/4 cups","2 tablespoons (345 grams) bread flour (divided; all-purpose is fine too)"],"src":"/static/c8f86f0f91cff172030e7216d8179ce0/Screenshot-from-2025-05-29-13-02-35.png"},{"id":"cG9zdDo4Nw==","uri":"/recipe/saffron-bun-cake/","title":"Saffron Bun Cake (“Saffransbutterkaka”)","slug":"saffron-bun-cake","content":"\n<p>We caught up with the co-founders of NEAT Method to talk about their new book, sustainable organizing tips, and how to finally tackle that scary junk drawer.</p>\n","rating":5,"preptime":5,"image":"/static/7fedb45df980a9d066a269499dfcb1d1/Screenshot-from-2025-05-29-12-57-37.png","note":"Saffron buns are a very important part of Swedish holidays; they’re most commonly baked for St. Lucia day on December 13th, but also for Christmas eve and day. Traditionally, they’re rolled into s-shaped buns and studded with raisins, but here I’ve filled them with a sugar-butter mixture, rolled the dough up like cinnamon buns, then baked the buns together in a springform pan.\r\n\r\nTips & Tricks\r\n• If you want to speed up the proofing process, place the bowl in the oven and turn on only the oven light. It adds just the right amount of warmth and acts as a DIY proofing box.\r\n\r\n• Make sure your saffron is fresh! If it's old or too low quality, it could make the buns taste too earthy.\r\n\r\n• To make ahead, assemble the buns and let them do their second rise in the fridge overnight.
