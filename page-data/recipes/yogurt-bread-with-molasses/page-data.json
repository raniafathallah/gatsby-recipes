It is hearty, healthy, moist, and just barely sweet. Be sure not to overmix.\r\nA few notes:\r\n- Use any flour you'd like; I like a mix of rye and white whole wheat, but you could also use spelt or regular whole wheat.\r\n- Honey will work as a substitute for molasses; it will just yield a milder flavor.\r\n- I measure flour by aerating it, scooping it with a spoon into my measuring cup, and leveling it off with the back of a knife.\r\n- You can use a combination of milk and yogurt; just remember to add a bit of vinegar in proportion to your milk. —Marian Bull","ingredients":["2 1/2 cups white whole wheat flour, measured as described above (I also like a mix of white whole wheat and rye, but use whatever you have on hand)","1/2 cup medium- or coarse-grind cornmeal","1 teaspoon kosher salt","1 teaspoon baking soda","1 2/3 cups whole milk yogurt, or 1 1/2 cups whole milk + 2 tablespoons white or apple cider vinegar","1/2 cup molasses","1 1/2 cups cranberries, chopped fruit, or nuts (optional)","1 piece Butter, for greasing the pan"],"src":"/static/48d118d6e7d451823f71614e57d60e5b/Screenshot-from-2025-05-29-13-08-50.png","title":"Yogurt Bread with Molasses"}},"pageContext":{"id":"cG9zdDoxMDU="}},"staticQueryHashes":["2847572436"],"slicesMap":{}}
