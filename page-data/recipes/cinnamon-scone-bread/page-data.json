They can be sweet or savory and filled with pretty much any combination of flavorings you can think of. This is my version of a cinnamon quick bread, adapted from my recipe for Royal Wedding Scones here in the archives. The layering technique is inspired by Joy the Baker's Cinnamon Sugar Pull-Apart Bread.\r\n\r\nThere are many different ways you could play with this recipe. Next time, I'd try some espresso powder in the streusel. The zest of an orange would be a nice addition to the dough. You could omit the currants and use chocolate chips. Some chopped apples nestled in with the streusel would be very good. You see, it's endless.\r\n\r\nThe layering technique is a little time consuming, but totally fun. It's almost like building a lasagna outside of the pan. And any which way you end up layering, it'll still taste good. So don't sweat it.\r\n\r\nIf you prefer, this recipe can be prepared like more traditional scones. Just divide the dough in two pieces, pat one piece into a 6-inch circle, brush with cream, and sprinkle with streusel. Pat the second piece of dough into a 6-inch circle, brush with cream, place on top of the first round, cream-side down. (You are essentially making a streusel sandwich.) Cut into 8 triangles. Brush scones with cream and sprinkle with sugar. Bake at 425° F for about 20 minutes. —mrslarkin","ingredients":["2 1/2 cups (11 1/4 ounces or 319 grams) all-purpose unbleached flour","1/4 cup granulated sugar, plus more for sprinkling on top of loaf","1 tablespoon baking powder","3/4 teaspoon kosher salt","6 tablespoons chilled unsalted butter, cut into cubes","1/2 cup currants","1/2 teaspoon cinnamon, cocoa powder, or espresso powder","1 cup heavy cream, plus more for brushing on dough","1 large egg","1 1/2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract"],"src":"/static/d410edd324517e783a4ceffba9b7e5d1/Screenshot-from-2025-05-29-13-14-46.png","title":"Cinnamon Scone Bread"}},"pageContext":{"id":"cG9zdDoxMTE="}},"staticQueryHashes":["2847572436"],"slicesMap":{}}
