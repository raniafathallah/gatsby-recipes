Traditionally, they’re rolled into s-shaped buns and studded with raisins, but here I’ve filled them with a sugar-butter mixture, rolled the dough up like cinnamon buns, then baked the buns together in a springform pan.\r\n\r\nTips & Tricks\r\n• If you want to speed up the proofing process, place the bowl in the oven and turn on only the oven light. It adds just the right amount of warmth and acts as a DIY proofing box.\r\n\r\n• Make sure your saffron is fresh! If it's old or too low quality, it could make the buns taste too earthy.\r\n\r\n• To make ahead, assemble the buns and let them do their second rise in the fridge overnight. Return to room temperature 30 minutes before baking. —Nea Arentzen","ingredients":["DOUGH","1/2 tablespoon (½ gram) loosely packed saffron","1/2 cup (99 grams) granulated white sugar, divided","2 1/2 teaspoons (7 grams) instant yeast (see tip)","1 cup (250 grams) whole milk, at room temperature","4 cups plus 2 ½ tablespoons (500 grams) bread flour (all-purpose is fine too)","2 large eggs","7 tablespoons (100 grams) unsalted butter, softened","3/4 teaspoon Diamond kosher crystal salt","FILLING","6 tablespoons (84 grams) unsalted butter, at room temperature","1/3 cup (66 grams) granulated white sugar","1 teaspoon vanilla extract","a pinch of kosher salt","TO FINISH","1 tablespoon melted butter","1/4 cup granulated sugar, or as much as needed"],"src":"/static/7fedb45df980a9d066a269499dfcb1d1/Screenshot-from-2025-05-29-12-57-37.png","title":"Saffron Bun Cake (“Saffransbutterkaka”)"}},"pageContext":{"id":"cG9zdDo4Nw=="}},"staticQueryHashes":["2847572436"],"slicesMap":{}}
