They can be sweet or savory and filled with pretty much any combination of flavorings you can think of. This is my version of a cinnamon quick bread, adapted from my recipe for Royal Wedding Scones here in the archives. The layering technique is inspired by Joy the Baker's Cinnamon Sugar Pull-Apart Bread.\r\n\r\nThere are many different ways you could play with this recipe. Next time, I'd try some espresso powder in the streusel. The zest of an orange would be a nice addition to the dough. You could omit the currants and use chocolate chips. Some chopped apples nestled in with the streusel would be very good. You see, it's endless.\r\n\r\nThe layering technique is a little time consuming, but totally fun. It's almost like building a lasagna outside of the pan. And any which way you end up layering, it'll still taste good. So don't sweat it.\r\n\r\nIf you prefer, this recipe can be prepared like more traditional scones. Just divide the dough in two pieces, pat one piece into a 6-inch circle, brush with cream, and sprinkle with streusel. Pat the second piece of dough into a 6-inch circle, brush with cream, place on top of the first round, cream-side down. (You are essentially making a streusel sandwich.) Cut into 8 triangles. Brush scones with cream and sprinkle with sugar. Bake at 425° F for about 20 minutes. —mrslarkin","title":"Cinnamon Scone Bread","slug":"cinnamon-scone-bread"},{"id":"cG9zdDoxMDU=","image":"/static/48d118d6e7d451823f71614e57d60e5b/Screenshot-from-2025-05-29-13-08-50.png","note":"This recipe is adapted from Mark Bittman's How to Cook Everything Vegetarian (Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2007). It is hearty, healthy, moist, and just barely sweet. Be sure not to overmix.\r\nA few notes:\r\n- Use any flour you'd like; I like a mix of rye and white whole wheat, but you could also use spelt or regular whole wheat.\r\n- Honey will work as a substitute for molasses; it will just yield a milder flavor.\r\n- I measure flour by aerating it, scooping it with a spoon into my measuring cup, and leveling it off with the back of a knife.\r\n- You can use a combination of milk and yogurt; just remember to add a bit of vinegar in proportion to your milk. —Marian Bull","title":"Yogurt Bread with Molasses","slug":"yogurt-bread-with-molasses"}]}},"pageContext":{"category":"Newest"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2847572436"],"slicesMap":{}}
